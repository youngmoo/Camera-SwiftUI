# VideoCam-SwiftUI

This package is forked from [Rolando Rodriguez's Camera-SwiftUI](https://github.com/rorodriguez116/Camera-SwiftUI) and his excellent [Effortless SwiftUI-- Camera](https://rorodriguez116.medium.com/effortless-swiftui-camera-d7a74abde37e) tutorial. The original captured still photos, and I wanted to be able to record video.

My goal was to have a simple video camera to use in Swift Playgrounds 4 projects on iPad.

# Usage
